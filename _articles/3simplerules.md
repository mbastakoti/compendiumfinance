#### Page xi ... Preface

As many of us remember, a very big investment firm, Long-Term Capital Management, went straight down
the tubes in 1998, even though it was run by Nobel laureates in economics and finance. Giant banks,
with the money to hire top investment talent, also discovered in 2008 that everything they thought
they knew about investing was wrong. As news stories about banking disasters around the world
continue to reveal, “experts” keep reaching this sad conclusion with depressing regularity.

Ordinary individual investors also fall victim to misconceptions fed to them and reinforced by a vast
array of “helpers.” These helpers comprise a pantheon of advice givers, some of whom may not realize
that they’re lending support to misconceptions: financial advisors, financial journalists, radio and
television personalities, and financial academics. Even the most conscientious helpers often don’t
know that many of the things they think are true about investing are, in fact, wrong. They are
themselves victims of misinformation—such as the cherry-picked data and “sophisticated” math lingo
that promise low risk and high returns—and they unwittingly victimize their clients and audiences in
turn. ...

#### Page 9 ... The Simplified Wall Street Portfolio

"Simplicity is the ultimate Sophistication." --- Leonardo Da Vinci

Many investors, as we've noted, are perplexed by the array of possible investment vehicles and
strategies, not to mention their costs. They would be justified to lower the number of alternatives
merely to reduce the price and product confusion and make it easier to make a decision, even if in
the process they missed some slightly better results. But in our case, the best alternative is just
plain as the nose on your face. It’s the least costly, the easiest implement, and the least risky
for the benefit an investor can expect to get from it.

With this in mind, we’ve designed to simplify Wall Street portfolio with just this five common
investment products at its core: ...


#### Page 135 ... Use the Strategies that **Always** Work

There are some things about investing you hear so incessantly that by now everybody just assumes
they’re right. The conventional wisdom is so riddled with error that you should question
virtually everything you hear. In this Deadly Temptation, we’ll address the following four
things you hear that are either wrong or at least not always right:


* The first thing you should always do is fund your 401(k) to the maximum.
* You must rebalance your investments regularly.
* Dollar-cost averaging always wins.
* Gold is a hedge against inflation.


See why these “tried and true” strategies don’t always work and following them may even be
harmful ...

#### Page 113 ... as for a Nobel Prize-Winning Approach

Most firms that offer financial advisory services perform an “asset allocation” for their clients
(or prospective clients), usually present it as a very important part of their service. They let
people know that a sophisticated computer model is used to create the asset allocation.
Frequently, they add that it employs Nobel Prize-winning technology.  In short, though, the idea
that asset allocation is or needs to be done using a sophisticated mathematical model is
essentially a hoax.

To explain this, we need to go back in history a few years. ...

#### Page 171 ... Use Modern Scientific Financial Theory

This is often the deadliest of temptations – and one of the most brazen. Science encompasses an array
of serious, well-developed fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Modern finance bears no
resemblance to any of them. To apply the term “science” to the field of modern finance is to taint
all sciences. Both science and engineering use mathematics in practical and sound ways. The
mathematics used in these fields is both much more sophisticated and more practical than the
mathematics used in the investment field.

Let’s explore some of the ways investment products and services sold by Wall Street and the financial
industry use – or pretend to use – mathematics and “modern scientific financial theory.” ...

#### Page 97 ... Do Investors really make bad decision on their own?

For number of years, a company named DALBAR has been publishing report called the  “Quantitative
Analysis of Investor Behavior” (QAIB). The QAIB purports to show that the investors make bad
decisions on their own and, as a result, their investments underperformed the market by several
percentage points. This material is a godsend to financial advisors because it implies that
investors need to hire an expensive financial advisor to help them.  It has captured headlines for
years, perpetuating the myth that individual investors invest poorly, and therefore they do much
worse than the market average. There’s just one thing: the DALBAR result is wrong.

We’ll first explain the problem in simple terms for those who don’t care to get into the technical
details. Then I’ll explain it more technically for those who do want to get into it. ...
