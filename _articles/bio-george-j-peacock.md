A 27-year investment industry veteran, George Peacock is a principal at Compendium Financial
Investment Advisory, the founder and manager of the Purchasing Power Portfolio, the author of the
Yoga of Investing blog. He entered the financial advisory business as an associate at American
Express Financial Services (now Ameriprise). He also worked at the Wallace Financial Group, a
regional insurance, investment, retirement, and financial planning firm, and Mullin Consulting,
advising Fortune 1000 companies on niche compensation benefits for their senior executives. He
returned to advising high-net-worth individuals and families when he joined the D.C. office of US
Trust, which was later purchased by Bank of America. Mr. Peacock left Bank of America when the firm,
like the rest of the investment industry, began relying increasingly on mathematical models whose
output depended on a myriad of unknowable assumptions.

At Euclid, he immediately established the Purchasing Power Portfolio, a precursor to the Simplify
Wall Street approach described in this book. Mr. Peacock is the president of the Georgetown
University Alumni Association and is an ex-officio member of the Universityâ€™s board of directors. He
is also a member of the External Advisory Board of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student
Federal Credit Union, the largest student-run credit union in the country, and The Georgetown
Chimes, an all-male a capella singing group. A part-time stand-up comic, he lives in Bethesda,
Maryland, with his four children, Duncan, June, Hayley, and Mackenzie.
