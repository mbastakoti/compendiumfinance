    <h1>The True Cost of Fees</h1>

    <p>Lowering fees could be one of the most important investing decisions you make. Whether they are classified as high, standard, or average,
    fees impact your investment income. Fees draw money from your account regardless of your investment activity. If you make a profit, fees are
    drawn from your account. If you make zero profits, fees are drawn from your account. If you hit a loss, fees are drawn from your account.
    Fees are often taken as a percentage of your investments. Because they are not usually presented in dollars and are automatically withdrawn
    from your account, fees are easily overlooked. The higher the fee, the less money you’ll make over time.</p>

    <p>Every time fees are withdrawn from your investment dollars; you don’t just lose money from paying the fees – there’s also an opportunity cost.
    You lose out on the opportunity of making additional profits from your total investments had those dollars stayed in your account. If those fee
    dollars were still in your total investment amount instead of being paid to your advisor or mutual fund, you would have made significantly more
    profit throughout your investing years.</p>

    <p><strong>Rate of Return</strong> is how much you expect to earn on your investments over time, written as a percentage 
      of your current investment amount. Because you can’t predict the future, you can make a best guess either based on your 
      past rate of return, or use one of many rate of return calculators available online. We automatically adjust your rate 
      of return for inflation, and default your rate of return to 5.25%, which you can change.</p>

    <p><strong>Fund Fees</strong> are the amount you pay to own a particular mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). Fund 
      fees range from 0.05% to 2.0% per year. These fees are deducted from your investment returns, usually quarterly, to 
      cover the administrative cost of managing the fund. To find your fund fee, enter your fund’s Ticker Symbol into Google, 
      and look for the Expense Ratio, which is your fund fee.</p>

    <p><strong>Advisor Fees</strong> are fees you pay to your financial planner, advisor, or broker-dealer to handle your accounts. Advisor fees are typically shown
    as a percentage (usually called Assets Under Management, or AUM) and average around 1% per year. If there is a person that you call about your
    investment accounts, it is likely you are paying this fee.  Call your contact and ask them for details on the fees you pay. They may not make
    it easy for you. Or search online for “[your financial institution] advisor fee”.</p>
