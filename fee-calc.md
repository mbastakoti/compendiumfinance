At Compendium Finance, we want to educate people so that they can be more effective as investors and planners.  Many topics can be made to sound extremely complex; we aim to do the opposite. Today may be the easiest and least expensive time in history to invest.  But you wouldn’t know that from watching CNBC or a local new business and market report.

To be a successful investor, you need to get at least two things right.  Those two things are your asset allocation over time and keeping your fees and costs as low as possible.  In this section we focus on your fees.

The first thing to understand and take to heart is that fees and costs matter a great deal over time. In large part they matter because every dollar you pay in fees is a dollar that is no longer invested and compounding in your account.  And though the compliment is questionably attributed to Einstein, many regard compound interest to be the Eighth Wonder of the World.

The second you need to know is how to find out what your current fees are and what you can do to reduce them.
**
The Magnitude of Fees and Costs Over Time**

Below is an illustration that shows how fees erode your investment success over time.  The example below was generated from our fee calculator. After we review how the calculator works, you may want to use it to see how your current fees could be affecting your future.

Let’s review the various inputs first.  As you can see above in the upper left section, the investor has $50,000 that will be invested for 30 years. This could be a 35-year-old investor with money in her 401(k) or perhaps a 65-year-old retiree for whom the $50,000 will be invested throughout his retirement. It doesn’t matter because the results are the same.

The investor has an assumed average annual return of 8%.  You can enter whatever long term return you believe is appropriate for your portfolio.

The cost to manage the investment portfolio is 1.31%.  We use that number because that is the average expense ratio of all mutual funds1.  Of course, you can pay far less than that but we’ll get to that later.

Finally, we assume this investor has a financial advisor who charges 1.18% of assets under management (AUM).  Again, that is an average fee paid to financial advisors2. Thus, for the $50,000 being managed, the fee for that year would be $590. ($50,000 x 1.18%=$590).  As the money grows over time, the actual fees paid (not the percentage) will increase as well.

So that’s all you need to know in order to use the fee calculator to see how fees affect you over time.

Given the above inputs, let’s take a closer look at the outputs below.

![original output.png](/uploads/original%20output.png)


At the top, you can see that the “total earned” was $503,132.  But all that remains in the account is $249,907, less than half. That’s what the investor gets to keep. The rest was paid out in fees and costs.  That is, this investor lost $253,225 in total fees and costs, slightly more than 50% of what could have been earned and retained.

The total loss, or “missed opportunity,” is made up of three separate fees and costs.

The first is the cost of managing your portfolio: $47,527.  As stated earlier, we assume a 1.31% annual fee for that, the cost of the average mutual fund.  Many people are paying higher than that for mutual funds and financial institution wrap accounts. You may also recall that the fee for the first year of investment management was “only” $590.  Notice how fees sometimes seem rather harmless when looked at from that narrow angle.

The second is the cost of having an investment advisor, which was set at 1.18%. That resulted in a loss of $42,811.

The third line is your “lost earnings. This is the hidden and almost never-talked-about cost to investing. And yet it is often the largest cost by far. In this example, the cost is $162,886, four times as much as paid to the mutual fund or advisor.  That is, $162,886 is what your money would have grown to if had been left in the account. That money would and could be there to spend during retirement.  That, and the other $90,000 that was paid to the mutual funds and advisor.

And this problem gets worse and worse for you each year the money is invested.

Once you truly understand the real long-term cost of fees, you will have no doubt that fees matter.  They matter a lot.

**You Can Make Difference**

Below, however, are the outcomes if you lower your portfolio expenses to .10% (very easy and wise to do) and avoid using a financial advisor who charges you based upon your assets under management (AUM).  The amount invested and investment return are the same, but look at how much money you have now after 30 years.

![low assumptions.png](/uploads/low%20assumptions.png)


Your “lost earnings” are still the cause of the greatest leakage from your account but this time it is only $8,000 instead of $162,882, a twenty-fold savings.

So can you really invest successfully by only paying .10% or less?  Yes, you can. There are several portfolios from which to choose.  All broadly diversified portfolios.  Diversified by geography, by industry, by company size, and by growth and value orientations -- all the attributes that investors like to diversity.

Such investments are offered by Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock, Schwab and other well-known and reputable investment management firms.  The non-cost benefits to investing this way is the subject of another page but, yes, you can do it. And it is about as simple as it can be.

But can you plan your financial life without an advisor?  Of course.  Many people have done so successfully.  And with the advent of technology solutions in this area, there is no better time to get all the personalized advice you need through a program or app.  Who would have imagined just a decade ago that even the most complex tax return could be completed fairly painlessly and often free through a variety of software offerings.  That is exactly where personal financial planning is heading and there are already many excellent programs available that will guide you at a very low cost.

Finally, can you really get all those “lost earnings” back? Absolutely.  Just don’t pay them out in fees and they’ll be there for you to use one day.
How To Find Out What You Are Paying in Fees

Finding out what fees you are paying can be really easy or really hard.  Let’s start with the easy.

Mutual Fund and Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs) are easy.  Fortunately, these are the investments that most individuals use.  Every mutual fund has what is called a Ticker Symbol.  For example, Vanguard’s Index 500 Investor Class Fund’s Ticker is VFINX. And Fidelity’s Index 500 Investor Class Index Fund’s Ticker is FUSEX. Each mutual fund and ETF that exist has a unique and identifying Ticker Symbol.

If you know you know your fund’s Ticker Symbol, you can find out almost anything about it through a Google search.  Typing FUSEX into a Google search engine brings up the information below:

![Screen Shot 2017-04-20 at 9.56.16 PM.png](/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202017-04-20%20at%209.56.16%20PM.png)


In the bottom right of the image you can see that the “Expense ratio” is .09%.  The expense ratio is your fee.  That is, for every $10,000 invested, you will pay $9. That is how easy it can be to find out what you are paying for portfolio management.  If you own mutual funds and ETFs and know their Ticker Symbol, finding your fees is usually that easy.

In the above example, you will never get an invoice for $9.  You will never write a check. The amount you owe is taken out of your share of the overall portfolio each and every day. So it is easy for most people to forget that they are paying anything for their mutual fund.

Side note: Occasionally, you may read an article about “hidden fees.”  Mutual funds provide an excellent example.  For some reason, in the U.S. the published expense ratio (ER) does not include certain costs such as trading and brokerage costs.  And trading can add a lot of costs to funds that are actively managed. Those costs are hidden costs and they can be material.  Here it may be enough to know that “Index” funds tend to have far lower trading costs than actively managed funds.  There is a strong correlation between a funds turnover ratio and trading costs.  The higher the turnover, the higher the trading costs.  Turnover ratio can be found in a fund Annual Report. Not totally hidden, but it may as well be.

What if you do not know the unique Ticker Symbol of your fund or funds? If you know only the name, you can search the fund name and you should easily find the Ticker Symbol.  But here you have to be a little more careful and detail oriented.  Try to make as sure as you can that you search for the exact name of the fund because there are often funds with very similar names.

For example, Fidelity has two S&P 500 Index Funds, the Fidelity Index 500 Investor Share Fund (FUSEX) that we have been following and the Fidelity Index 500 Premium Share Fund (FUSVX).  The difference?  As we have seen, FUSEX has a .09% expense ratio.  FUSVX, however, has a .045% expense ratio.  While they are both very inexpensive, FUSVX is 50% lower.  Why is that?  It is essentially the same S&P 500 portfolio but FUSEX has a minimum investment of $2,500 and FUSVX has a minimum investment of $10,000.  The difference in expense ratios charged against the shares is a function of the cost involved in recordkeeping and other expenses related to having many more smaller accounts versus fewer accounts with larger balances.

Of course, either option would be excellent and far lower than the 1.31% average for mutual funds.  But if you can take advantage of the lower expense shares, it makes sense to do so.

To recap, if you know the Ticker Symbol for your mutual fund(s), finding your fee (expense ratio) will likely be very easy. If you know the name, you should be able to easily find the Ticker Symbol, but remember to make sure that you have the exact and full name of the fund.
401(k)s -- A Special Case

For many people, 401(k) investments are their largest holdings.  401(k)s can present unique difficulties in determining your fees and costs. Much of the information is available but sometimes a little reading and digging is necessary.

The best case scenario is that your quarterly 401(k) statement actually lists the Ticker Symbols for your investment options. Well, that was easy. Use the Ticker Symbol to get the information you need just as you would with any other mutual fund or ETF.

If not, the next quickest option is simply to call the company that manages your 401(k); their number should be on statements that you receive.  There are also documents that your employer must provide annually that provide all this information but finding it could mean a call to HR to have them send you the most recent version and then some very careful reading of a 90-page document. Avoiding that chore is probably worth a few minutes on hold.

Even after getting the expense ratios of the funds in which you are invested, you have one more question to ask HR.  There are costs to offering a 401(k) Plan to employees.  There are recordkeeping, administration, and compliance costs.  Sometimes, but infrequently, the employers pays the costs directly.  But most of the time, the cost of the plan is shared by all the participants in the plan. Such costs are usually in the form of an additional asset management fee layered on top of the expense ratios of the individual funds. Your HR department should know whether that is the case for your plan and, if so, what that fee is.  Once you get that, you can enter that asset fee on the “Advisor Fee” line in the fee calculator.

In summary, investment and advisor fees can make an enormous difference over time. For younger investors, this issue of time is obvious.  But even a newly-retired 65-year-old may have assets invested for another 30 years and fees will erode her account the same way.  And it all happens without ever writing a check or getting a bill, so it is all too easy to ignore.
