Whether they are classified as high, standard, or average, fees impact your investment income.
Fees draw money from your account regardless of your investment activity. If you make a profit,
fees are drawn from your account. If you make zero profits, fees are drawn from your account. If
you hit a loss, fees are drawn from your account. Fees are often taken as a percentage of your investments.
Because they are not usually presented in dollars and automatically withdrawn from your account,
they are easily overlooked. The higher the fee, the less money that you have for retirement. Every
time you use part of your investment to pay your fee, not only do you lose the fee amount, but you
also lose any interest you would have made on that amount throughout your investing years.

**Fund fees** are the amount you pay to own a particular mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Fund fees range from .05% to 2.0% and more. These fees are deducted from your investment returns,
usually quarterly, to cover the administrative cost of managing the fund.


You pay **advisor fees** to your financial planner, advisor, or broker-dealer to handle your accounts.
If there is a person that you call about your investment accounts, it is likely you are paying this fee.
Call your contact and ask them for details on the fees you pay. Search online for “[your financial institution] advisor fee”.
They may not make it easy for you. Advisor fees are usually 1.0% or more.  This can have an extreme impact on your
retirement income.  Advisor fees, when shown as a percentage (usually called Assets Under Management, or AUM), don't
feel like that much money.  Even though it doesn't feel like a lot, over the duration of your retirement, it is.
