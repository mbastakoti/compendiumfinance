## 17. DISPUTE AND ARBITRATION

### 17.1 Agreement to Arbitrate

You and Compendium agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising in connection with Terms or your relationship with Compendium as a user of its Website (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms) shall be resolved by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow the Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Terms.

### 17.2 Exceptions

Notwithstanding the provision 17.1 above, you and Compendium both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (i) bring an individual action in a United States small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable United States federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

### 17.3 Arbitration Rules

Any arbitration between you and us will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by the Terms. You and Compendium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, so the United States Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as filing instructions and forms are available by contacting Compendium, online at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

### 17.4 Arbitrator

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

### 17.5 Notice; Process

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Compendium’s address for Notice is:

Compendium Finance, LLC   
13880 Dulles Corner Lane, Suite 300   
Herndon, VA 20171

The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Compendium may commence an arbitration proceeding.

Unless you and Compendium otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Fairfax County, Virginia, provided your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Compendium submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Compendium shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Compendium shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Compendium in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00 USD, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator’s decision and award, neither you nor Compendium shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.

### 17.6. Arbitrator’s Decision

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The prevailing party in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorney fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. 

### 17.7. Modifications

In the event that Compendium makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to our address for Notice), you may reject any such change by discontinuing use of the Website.

### 17.8. Class Action Waiver

WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND COMPENDIUM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, arbitrator or judge may not consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### 17.9. Enforceability

If the class action waiver in 17.8 above is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms.

### 18. GENERAL

Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the Website, and the Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and us regarding the Website. Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer the Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may freely assign or transfer the Terms without notice. Any failure by Compendium or third party beneficiary to enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.

### 19. HOW TO CONTACT US
