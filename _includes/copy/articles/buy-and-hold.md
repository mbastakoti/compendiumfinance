For a couple of decades, financial advisors have been recommending that investors regularly
“rebalance” their portfolio. This chorus has gotten louder and louder. It's so loud now that most
online investment firms automatically rebalance their customers portfolios. In fact, at some firms,
customers do not even have a choice. These firms and others tout what they call the “rebalancing
bonus” and even suggest a specific number that rebalancing adds to returns over time, .4%.

This is the result of one study that was done nearly 20 years ago. It hasn’t been redone or confirmed
because the industry has no incentive to risk slaying a Golden Goose.

In the article below, Michael Edesess clearly exposes the flawed methodology and math involved in
the original study by former neurologist,
[William Bernstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Bernstein). He
then uses historical data (over a far greater period than the original Bernstein test) to run a
simulation with the corrected methodology.

And what was the answer? Rebalancing did beat buy-and-hold most of the time; however it was by a
small amount. However, when buy-and-hold beat rebalancing it was by about twice as large an amount.
Between these two effects, the mean result was essentially a wash.

That is, despite what the industry touts (presumably to promote their own systems and value), there
is NO predictive or reliable rebalancing bonus. Not of .4%. Not of anything. In fact, the data show
that rebalancing can often have a negative effect on performance. Further, rebalancing usually has
costs that a buy and hold strategy does not, such as transactions costs and, potentially, taxes.
