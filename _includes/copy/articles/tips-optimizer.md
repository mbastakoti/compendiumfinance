At or near retirement, we recommend creating your own guaranteed income floor. We recommend using a
combination of a deferred annuity and a laddered portfolio of TIPS. The primary goal of the
spreadsheet is to plan for a retirement income floor that will provide for your essentials. Once
this floor has been established, one can add to that guarantee income stream through additional TIPS
and annuity purchases or invest additional savings in a risk-based portfolio (e.g., stocks, real
estate, etc.) in the hopes of growing those assets in excess of the inflation rate.


Ideally at retirement, one would simply create a laddered portfolio of Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities (TIPS) that would last for the exact duration of your lifetime. You would set up the TIPS
portfolio such and that each year inflation-protected, government-backed bonds would come due in an
amount necessary for you to pay for your essential costs of living for that year.


Since you do not know, however, how long you will live, we recommend combining a laddered TIPS
portfolio with deferred income annuities issued by insurance companies. Annuities provide a stated
income that you cannot outlive (that guarantee is backed by the insurance company).


The goal of the spreadsheet is to help you figure out how long the TIPS should be used and at what
point the deferred annuity income should start. The answer will be a function of the TIPS yield and
annuity pricing at the time that one is locking in a desired income stream. Download it here:
