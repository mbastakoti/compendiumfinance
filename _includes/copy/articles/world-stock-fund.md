Earlier we listed total US stock fund and total international stock fund options. This allows
investors to deviate from the true global market weighting, which is skewed towards international
stocks. Many US investors choose to weight their US and international funds at 50% each or even
slightly more heavily in favor of the US because of concerns about currency risk or because of what
some observers call home country bias. We have no problem with that. But as with most things,
remember, “home country bias” in moderation.


For those of you market purists, however, you can take care of the your diversified stock risk
allocation in one fell swoop a global or world total stock fund. Again, Vanguard has both a fund,
Total World Stock Index Fund (VTWSX) and an ETF version, Total World Stock ETF (VT).
