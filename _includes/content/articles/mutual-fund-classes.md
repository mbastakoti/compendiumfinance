#### What are Mutual Fund Classes?

A given mutual fund, with one portfolio and one investment adviser, may offer more than one "class"
of its shares to investors. Each class represents a similar interest in the mutual fund's portfolio.
The primary difference between the classes is that the mutual fund will charge you different fees
and expenses depending on the class you choose.



#### What Types of Fees and Expenses Will I Pay?

Like most investments, all mutual funds charge fees and expenses that are paid by the investors.
These fees and expenses can vary widely from fund to fund or, as we will discuss below, fund share
class to fund share class. Because even small differences in expenses can make a big difference in
your return over time, this is an important consideration when choosing which class of share you
will invest in. You can also check the fee table in the mutual fund's prospectus to find out about
its fees and expenses.



#### If You Buy Class A Shares:

Class A shares typically charge a front-end sales charge. When you buy Class A shares with a
front-end sales charge, a portion of your dollars is not invested. Class A shares may impose an
asset-based sales charge, but it generally is lower than the charge imposed by the other classes.


A mutual fund may offer you discounts, called breakpoints discounts, on the front-end sales charge
if you:

* Make a large purchase.
* Already hold other mutual funds offered by the same fund family.
* Commit to regularly purchasing the mutual fund's shares.

In our view, there is never any reason whatsoever to purchase any mutual fund with any front-end
sales charge.


#### If You Buy Class B Shares:

Class B shares typically do not charge a front-end sales charge, but they do impose asset-based
sales charges that may be higher than those that you would pay if you purchased Class A shares.
Class B shares also normally impose a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which you would pay
if you sell your shares within a certain period, often six years. For this reason, these shares
should not be referred to as "no-load" shares. The CDSC normally declines the longer you hold your
shares and, eventually, is eliminated. Within two years after the CDSC is eliminated, Class B shares
often "convert" into lower-cost Class A shares. When they convert, they begin to charge the same
fees as Class A shares.


Class B shares do not impose a sales charge at the time of purchase. So unlike Class A purchases,
all of your dollars are immediately invested. But your annual expenses, as measured by the expense
ratio, may be higher. You also may pay a sales charge when you sell your Class B shares.


Again, we see no reason whatsoever to ever purchase B shares.

#### If You Buy Class C Shares:

Class C shares do not impose a front-end sales charge on the purchase, so the full dollar amount
that you pay is invested. Often Class C shares impose a small charge (often 1 percent) if you sell
your shares within a short time, usually one year. They typically impose higher asset-based sales
charges than Class A shares and, since they generally do not convert into Class A shares, those fees
will not be reduced over time.
Additionally, in most cases, your total cost would be higher than with Class A shares, and even
Class B shares, if you hold for a long time.

Never buy C shares.


#### Glossary of Terms: Fees and Expenses

##### Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC)

This fee is charged when you sell your mutual fund shares. For example, if you redeem shares valued
at $1,000, and the mutual fund imposes a CDSC of 1 percent, you would be charged $10 and receive
$990. For B shares, CDSCs normally decline over time and, eventually, are eliminated after six years
from the purchase of those shares.


##### Expense Ratio

A measure of the fund's total annual expenses expressed as a percentage of the fund's net assets.
For example, an expense ratio of 1 percent represents an annual charge to the fund's
assets—including your proportional interest in those assets—of 1 percent every year.
The expense ratio includes management fees, marketing and distribution fees (often called 12b-1
fees) and other ongoing fees that are deducted from a mutual fund's assets. These fees pay for the
services of the mutual fund's investment adviser, the selling advisor or broker, transfer agent, and
for other expenses. Front-end sales charges and CDSCs are not included in the expense ratio because
they are charged once, and directly to the investor.
The fee table in the front of a mutual fund's prospectus shows the expense ratio, front-end sales
charges, and CDSCs.



##### Front-End Sales Charge

This fee is charged when you purchase mutual fund shares. For example, you spend $1,000 to purchase
Class A shares and the fund imposes a front-end sales charge of 5 percent. You are charged $50 on
your purchase and receive shares with a market value of $950. Depending on the size of your
purchase, a breakpoint discount can lower this sales charge.


##### Breakpoint Discounts

A mutual fund may offer you discounts, called breakpoint discounts, on the front-end sales charge if
you:


* Make a large purchase.
* Already hold other mutual funds offered by the same fund family.
* Commit to regularly purchasing the mutual fund's shares.



#####  Asset-Based Sales Charges

These are fees you would not pay directly, but which are taken out of a mutual fund's assets to pay
to market and distribute its shares. For example, asset-based sales charges can be used to
compensate a broker for the sale of mutual fund shares, for advertisements and to print copies of
the prospectus. Asset-based sales charges include Rule 12b-1 fees, which are dedicated to these
types of distribution costs.
