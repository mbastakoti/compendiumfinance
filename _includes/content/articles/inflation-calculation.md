The price index that governs inflation adjustments in the value of a TIPS contract is compiled by
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and called the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Customers
(CPI-U). It tracks the monthly price changes of a basket of goods and services purchased by a
typical resident of an urban or metropolitan area in the United States.


How is the CPI market basket determined? The CPI market basket is developed from detailed
expenditure information provided by families and individuals on what they actually bought. For the
current CPI, this information was collected from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 2009 and 2010.
In each of those years, about 7,000 families from around the country provided information each
quarter on their spending habits in the interview survey. To collect information on frequently
purchased items, such as food and personal care products, another 7,000 families in each of these
years kept diaries listing everything they bought during a 2-week period.


Over the 2 year period, then, expenditure information came from approximately 28,000 weekly diaries
and 60,000 quarterly interviews used to determine the importance, or weight, of the more than 200
item categories in the CPI index structure. The information compiled by the survey is representative
of about 87 percent of the total U.S. population. Nevertheless, individual consumers or households
may have different expenditure patterns and therefore different month-to-month or year-to-year
changes in their cost of living.
