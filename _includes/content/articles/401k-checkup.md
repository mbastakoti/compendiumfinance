It is taken as a given among financial advisors and their clients that, to the extent that one is
able, one should always contribute the maximum amount allowable into a 401(k) or other tax deferred
account.


To make things simple, we’ll generally agree that this is true where there is a company
match involved (at least to the extent of that match and presuming reasonable 401(k) fees). But what
about contributing money to your 401(k) once it is just your own dollars and no company match? Is
that the best strategy?


In short, the answer is not that simple because most of the factors needed to determine it are
unknowable. It is dependent upon your actual investment return and the tax rates for each dollar
invested and each dollar withdrawn and what the taxes rates are for dividends and interest.


Further, one must pit the expenses of the 401(k) (both the investment option and administrative
expenses) against the fees incurred when investing the money on your own. For the most part, expense
information is largely knowable information -- though finding out all of the fees you pay through
your 401(k) is extremely difficult. In some cases, even the people who manage the company 401(k)
don’t even seem to know. The Department of Labor has been trying to demand that employers provide
more and more clarity to participants but there still seems to be a long way to go.


When you add up all the fees and consider the fact that you are likely the one paying all of them,
it’s not a “slam dunk” that the 401(k) is better than simply paying taxes on your earnings and
investing in, for example, a low turnover, ultra low fee, highly diversified total world index stock
fund. Download the spreadsheet to find out what you should do:
