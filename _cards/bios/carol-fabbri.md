Carol Fabbri, an experienced financial advisor, certified financial planner, and certified advisor in
philanthropy, cofounded Fair Advisors in 2008. As the managing partner of Fair Advisors LLC, an
independent financial advisory firm, she works with individuals and nonprofit organizations. Prior
to that role, she worked as an advisor at Merrill Lynch and formerly spent a decade as an international
business consultant after receiving an MBA at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. 

She leverages her
consulting experience to educate her audiences and simplify the seemingly complex financial
environment. She also works with individuals to achieve their goals using financial, estate planning, and
philanthropic tools. Ms. Fabbri’s unique and clear perspective on personal finance issues is often
quoted in the national press, including Forbes, Smart Money, and the Wall Street Journal. She is the
coauthor of Personal Investing: The Missing Manual (O’Reilly, 2010).

To address the broad need for financial literacy courses, she founded Fair Advisors Institute (FAI),
a nonprofit dedicated to improving financial literacy through education and research. In 2012, FAI
received the “Right on the Money” award for its work providing financial education to foster youth.
Her efforts toward educating individuals about personal finance have been recognized locally and
nationally. 

Ms. Fabbri received the TIAW World of Difference Award for her work economically empowering women
and has been recognized as a Colorado Top Wealth Advisor. She recently received her black belt in
taekwondo and lives in the mountains of Colorado with her husband and son.
