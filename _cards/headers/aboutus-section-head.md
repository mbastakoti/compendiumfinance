lead: "You would not know it from the mainstream financial services industry but investing
  today is as easy as it has ever been and can be extremely inexpensive. And while
  retirement planning does have several moving parts and a few decisions to be made,
  it too can be made rather simple. \n\nIn order to know what to do, though, it is
  sometimes important to know what not to do. And that is the case in investing because
  the financial industry has cultivated confusing and sometimes misleading folklore
  and myths. There are four topics in particular that deserve focus and attention:
  Fees & Costs, Asset Allocation, Investing, Rebalancing, and Tax-Loss Harvesting."
