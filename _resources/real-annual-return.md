It is essential that every investor understand and appreciate the difference between “real” returns
and “nominal” returns. The investment industry almost always uses nominal returns. That is, they
will tell you quite simply what an investment returned.


Now that sounds like all you would need to know but it most definitely is not.


The goal of every investor has to be to maintain or grow your “purchasing power.” That is, if you
set aside $1 today, you want it to buy as much or more 1, 10, or 30 years later. At the end of the
day, money is measured by what you can buy with it; thus, maintaining or improving your purchasing
power is the fundamental goal of setting money today in order to spend it at some later tomorrow.
Investors do not always achieve that goal, but it is the goal nonetheless.


For example, if you could be guaranteed a fixed 8% return for the next 30 years, would you take it?
Most people, especially in today’s 1% or less return environment, would leap at the opportunity. And
maybe that choice would turn out ok. BUT, without knowing what inflation will be over the next 30
years, you really don’t know what kind of investment opportunity it really is.


If prices for goods and services (food, energy, and, well, stuff) increased by 10% per year over
that same period, you would have lost value over time. That’s because although your investment
increased by 8% per year, prices for what you want to buy increased at 10% per year. You would be
able to buy less and less each year.


Inflation is hard to truly measure but we all know that prices (in general) have tended to increase
over time. We remember dime sodas, $.25 per gallon gas and median homes costing about $17,000. The
government computes and publishes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as an official measure (for
government benefits, TIPS, and other purposes).


Nominal returns, especially in long-term projections can make you think you will have a lot more
money than you actually will.
