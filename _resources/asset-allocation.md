**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**


**Asset allocation refers to the division of a portfolio’s market value at a moment in time among major asset classes. Major asset classes are stocks, bonds, cash and subsets of each -- large company stocks, international stocks, or government bonds, for example.  An investor’s asset allocation is typically depicted with a pie chart (e.g. Figure 1).**

**Asset allocation has assumed a central role in the advice delivered by most other financial advisors for two reasons. First, a mathematical model developed by Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz provided a way to theoretically optimize the allocation of a portfolio of securities or asset classes. The model is technically called a “mean-variance optimization model and is casually referred to as an “asset allocation model.” Second, the use of this model has proved to be an extremely effective sales tool for financial advisers in gathering and “managing” client assets.**

**The model does not work in practice, however, because model results are highly sensitive to the values of the model’s very large number of required inputs -- and accurate values of those inputs are unobtainable in practice. Nevertheless, financial advisory firms go through the motions of using those models to create an asset allocation for clients.**

**The proportional weights of the allocation of a portfolio at the moment in time to its various asset classes based on the current market values of those assets is information that is not very helpful to a long-term investment strategy, which is designed to procure both a secure and a substantial income stream for the investor many years in the future.**

**These momentary snapshots of relative market values of portfolio asset class investments do not have any direct relevance to the formulation of a meaningful investment strategy.**

Asset allocation refers to the division of a portfolio’s market value at a moment in time among the major asset classes in which it is invested.

For example, those major asset classes could include U.S. equities, U.S. long-term fixed income (i.e., bonds), foreign (non-U.S.) developed economy equities, emerging economy equities, foreign (non-U.S.) bonds, and cash equivalents (i.e., short-term fixed income instruments such as short-term bonds and bank deposits). Asset allocation at a point in time is commonly depicted by a pie chart, as in Figure 1.

**Figure 1. Asset Allocation**

Asset allocation could include additional asset categories as well, such as real estate, commodities, precious metals (e.g., gold), and “alternative” investments, including private equity and hedge funds (which are often themselves invested in equities).

Asset allocation is also often applied to asset categories within equities, or within bonds. For example, equities are frequently divided among the categories large growth, large value, small growth, small value, and medium-cap growth and value (companies with medium-sized total equity market capitalization). The term “growth” applies to companies whose share prices are high compared to the book values of the companies, hence implying expectations of high growth of earnings in the future, while “value” applies to companies with low share prices relative to the book values of assets.

What all of these definitions of asset allocation have in common, is that they are measured at a point in time using as the relative price of each asset its price as of the last market trade or bid-ask spread. If the portfolio is very large, such as the portfolio of a large mutual fund or pension fund, then it is only in theory that this is the price for which each asset would sell; the act of selling all those assets in the marketplace would change their prices. And if there is no intention of selling the assets in the near future, their market values at a point in time – if they are, for example, fixed income securities intended to be held to maturity – may be of little concern to the investor.

As will become clear in this and other of our position papers, these relative market values of portfolio assets at a moment in time do not have any direct relevance to the formulation of a meaningful investment strategy.

**Why then is asset allocation so central to the recommendations of so many other investment advisors?**

To answer this question we must delve into the history of development of so-called “modern portfolio theory” (MPT).

This development was launched by the work of Harry Markowitz, whose article “Portfolio Selection” was published in The Journal of Finance in 1952. Markowitz won a Nobel Prize for this work in 1990.

Prior to Markowitz’s work, the chief theory of portfolio selection was to compare the expected returns on various individual securities, such as shares of General Electric or IBM, and select the ones with the highest expected returns. Markowitz pointed out that this method made no allowance for the uncertainty of those expectations. Thus, for example, shares of GE might have offered an expected return of 12% a year, but with a 30% probability that the return would turn out to be less than only 4%, while government bonds offered a 5% return with certainty. Which to choose?

In short, the dispersion of the possible returns should come into play, not just the one-point expected value, or average of those returns. The dispersion of the probability distribution of returns is in theory related to the returns’ variability over time, also called their volatility. Therefore, the higher the volatility of the returns on a security, the higher the uncertainty about its expected long-run return.

Markowitz argued that it was not enough to maximize expected return; the uncertainty of that return – for which he took the return’s volatility over time to be a proxy – should also be minimized.

It is not in general possible, however, to both maximize expected return and minimize volatility. There is a trade-off. Investors will demand a lower price, and thus a higher return – a premium – to invest in stocks with more uncertain futures. Hence, the more you try to maximize expected return, the more you must accept greater volatility.

Therefore Markowitz created a graph with two variables, “expected return” and “volatility of return” (see Figure 2). He labeled the latter – the volatility of a security’s or a portfolio’s return – its “risk.” The problem then became to maximize a portfolio’s expected return, given an acceptable level of risk. (Or vice versa, to minimize a portfolio’s risk, given an acceptable expected return.)

Furthermore, Markowitz noted that the variabilities of any two securities were more or less correlated. When one went up or down, the other moved up or down more or less simultaneously. The ideal, in order to reduce the risk – the dispersion of possible returns – was to combine securities that did not move up or down together very much, i.e. ones that were relatively uncorrelated.

All of this led Markowitz, a mathematician who worked at the RAND Corporation in 1952, a hotbed of mathematical optimization, to develop an algorithm that calculated the weighted combination of securities that theoretically maximized the expected return for any given level of risk. He called the curve on the risk-return graph formed by the expected return-maximizing portfolios the “efficient frontier” (Figure 2). The method he developed is known as “mean-variance optimization.”

**Nice theory, but unfortunately useless in practice**

This theory excited people in the investment and finance professions, especially those who were seeking to make their subject appear more mathematically sophisticated – a mania that continues to this day. It gave them a computable algorithm with which they could – in principle – maximize the return on a portfolio for a given level of “risk.”

But mean-variance optimization requires many numerical inputs. For example, if there are 1,000 securities to be included in a portfolio, running a mean-variance optimization to find the optimal portfolio for any risk level requires no less than 501,500 numerical inputs! These numbers consist of 1,000 expected returns, 1,000 volatilities (standard deviations) of returns, and 499,500 correlation coefficients between pairs of securities.

The first analysts who were excited about running Markowitz’s algorithm obtained the inputs by using their historical values. That is, they used the historical long-term returns on the securities as the expected returns, and the historical standard deviations and correlations of the securities’ returns as the future standard deviations and correlations.

When these analysts ran the algorithm they got absurd results. Instead of producing a diversified portfolio, the algorithm would produce a ridiculous portfolio, consisting, for example, of only one or two securities. That was because those securities were the ones that had had the highest historic returns, or the lowest standard deviations of returns. But the analysts knew that historically high returns were not a good predictor of future returns; and furthermore, the portfolios that resulted were obviously not well-diversified. Hence, the results had to be jettisoned.

**Enter “Asset Allocation”**

Analysts and academic researchers tried various “tweaks” to try to make it easier to obtain the input numbers and to make the algorithm come out “right” – that is, to make it produce an answer that would seem reasonable and acceptable to potential clients. For example, they tried dividing the securities into sectors and making the correlation coefficients all the same within a sector, and they tried rigging the expected returns in various ways so that the result of running the algorithm wouldn’t turn out to be so unacceptable. But the sheer number of inputs that the algorithm required to construct an optimally-weighted portfolio with hundreds or thousands of individual securities was daunting. Also, its results were often exquisitely sensitive to small and arbitrary changes in the inputs.

In 1986 an article was published that saved the day for the would-be users of mean-variance optimization. Being able to use mathematical optimization was desirable for many reasons. First, starting in the late 1950s, it became more and more important to put mathematics – or at least the appearance of mathematics – into articles aspiring to be published in academic journals. (Even today, much of the mathematics used in finance wouldn’t be regarded as real mathematics by mathematicians, because it doesn’t rise to the required level of model-specificity or rigor, or simply contains serious errors.) Second, in the business of selling investment products or investment advice to investors, the appearance of mathematical sophistication was and remains an excellent sales tool.

The 1986 article, published in the Financial Analysts Journal and coauthored by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower (BHB) was titled, “Determinants of Portfolio Performance.” It compiled investment performance information for 91 large pension funds over the 10-year period 1974-1983. It found that more than 90% of the variation in performance among the funds was accounted for by their “asset allocation.” In BHB’s case, asset allocation meant merely the division of the portfolio among three asset classes: equities, fixed income, and cash.

In other words, the result was that the vast majority of the differences in performance were accounted for by how large a portion of the portfolio was invested in equities. Simple and obvious though its conclusion was, the result was picked up on by investment consultants and advisors, and gave new life to mean-variance optimization – or at least new life to its use as a sales tool.

It reduced the inputs required by the model to a manageable number – approximately 65 or so – since it reduced the number of assets to about ten asset classes instead of hundreds or thousands of individual securities. Nevertheless, the challenge of obtaining those inputs remained between daunting and impossible.

**Why mean-variance optimization doesn’t work for asset allocation**

Any method of obtaining the inputs from unaltered historical data causes the mean-variance optimization model to produce unacceptable results. The upshot is that when mean-variance optimization is run, either of two “fixes” is generally applied to force the results it produces to be what the operator of the model regards as reasonable. Either

1.     the inputs themselves are carefully manipulated, usually by trial and error, or by forms of mathematical reverse engineering, to make the results come out as desired; or
2.     constraints on the output allocations are imposed on the model, to directly force the resulting allocations to come out as desired;
or both of the above.

Thus, running a mean-variance optimization is in essence a charade. Its results are not a revelation or answer produced by the model, as would be the case for most mathematical models used in science and engineering. Rather, the results are simply forced to be whatever the model operator desires them to be. And the model operator (the financial firm or advisor) always wants the results to be persuasive and sellable.

**Even though it doesn’t work, it is a marvelous sales tool**

So how can such a charade be used so widely by financial and investment advisors and consultants? It is used because it is very effective at impressing clients and prospects.

Here is how the model is typically used in the process of selling investment services, or rather, how the appearance of applying the model is used.

Let us say that the seller of the investment services is a financial advisor working for a large financial firm. We’ll name that advisor Jones. Jones is eager to land a prospective client, whom we will call Smith. If Jones is able to land Smith as a client, Jones will be able to take one percent (1%) of Smith’s portfolio as Jones’s fee every year, perhaps for as long as Smith lives. That is a very large fee indeed. It can drain 25% to 50% of Smith’s future income and savings, or more, and award them to Jones and Jones’s employer, as our fee calculator shows.

Advisor Jones asks prospect Smith for information about Smith’s current portfolio. Then Jones constructs a chart as shown in Figure 3.

**Figure 3. “Value Added”**

<img src="/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-04%20at%203.43.10%20PM.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>


Jones’s firm has already constructed the efficient frontier of portfolios that supposedly maximize portfolio expected return for each level of portfolio volatility, using – or in truth, not really using – Markowitz’s mean-variance optimization algorithm. (Jones may even say that his firm uses “Nobel prize winning technology” to optimize these portfolios.)

Given the same inputs of expected returns, volatilities, and correlations of the asset classes that were used to construct the efficient frontier, any portfolio that does not already lie on the efficient frontier will, of necessity, lie below it. Therefore, when advisor Jones points to prospect Smith’s portfolio, it appears that that the portfolio could be improved so as to increase its expected return at the same level of risk. This apparent result is illusory, however; it is nothing more than a result of the rigged construction of the model.

If slightly different model inputs had been used, Smith’s current portfolio would have been right on the efficient frontier, and the portfolios on the efficient frontier that Jones’s firm created would lie below it. In other words, the appearance of underperformance of Smith’s current portfolio is the result of Jones’s firm holding all the cards – of Jones’s firm controlling the inputs to the model.

**Why this asset allocation is, in any case, irrelevant to personal investment planning**

The objective of virtually all personal investment planning is to produce an income stream in the future. That income stream may extend over many years in the future. It may not begin for many years, if, for example, the investor seeks to create income in retirement, and retirement will not occur for one or two decades or more in the future.

This is a challenge that can only be met by an investment strategy that applies over a long period of time, not just to a point in time. Even the average of asset allocations over many future times provides little information about what income stream can be obtained in the future, and with what level of certainty.

As will be explained in more detail elsewhere, we believe the objective is to obtain at least a bare minimum income stream with predictable certainty, while facilitating an aspiration to achieve a higher income stream – perhaps a much higher income stream – but with less certainty. This can be done. It requires only one decision on the part of the investor: the specification of an acceptable minimum income stream that must be secured with certainty. If investment results allow, this minimum secure income stream can be increased over time.

The asset allocation of the portfolio at a point in time, or even its average over many points in time, is purely incidental to the implementation of this strategy. The extravagant attention paid to asset allocation in the financial industry is an artefact created by, on the one hand, misguided attempts to apply in practice academic results that are largely purely theoretical; and on the other hand, the astonishing effectiveness of its use as a sales tool to sell investment services. Since our goal is to provide investment advice and services solely through the medium of creating a logical, not an illusory benefit for the client, we do not engage in either of these practices.
