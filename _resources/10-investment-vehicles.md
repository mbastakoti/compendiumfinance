The 10, maximum and in order, investments you’ll ever need for an effective long-term portfolio.


#### 1. 

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. The closest thing you’ll ever get to a guarantee in the
investment world. These bond protect you from inflation, deflation, and default. A ["laddered
portfolio”](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondladder.asp) of TIPS should form the bedrock of every person’s financial plan. 
[An introduction to TIPS.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/tips.asp)


#### 2. 

The basic risk component of every person’s portfolio ought to be a U.S. Domestic Equity Index
[Mutual Fund](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) or [ETF.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) As of June, 2014, a couple great options in this regard are:


* [Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)
* [Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)
* [iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF (ITOT)](http://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-cap-funds/ishares-core-s%26p-total-u.s.-stock-market-etf/itot)
* [Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) (less inclusive of whole market)](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911206)


#### 3. 

For broadly diversified international exposure, which we recommend, here are a few options:

* [Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT)
* [Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3369&FundIntExt=INT)
* [iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF](http://www.ishares.com/us/products/244048/ishares-core-msci-total-international-stock-etf)


#### 4. 

Single premium and Deferred Income Annuities should be used in concert with a laddered TIPS
portfolio to protect against the risk of “living too long.” That is, living beyond what you had
planned. TIPS guarantee that you will be paid (default risk) and ensure that your investment will
keep pace with the rising cost of goods. Annuities provide an income that you cannot outlive. The
combination is important. The market is competitive and changes all the time. We will be adding more
information about options to this site in the future.


#### 5. 

For the vast majority of people, [“term” life insurance](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) is all you’ll ever need. There are
fancier forms of life insurance and forms of insurance that accumulate “cash value,” such as whole
life, universal life, variable universal life and several more. In short, they can made to sound
very good but it is very rarely a good idea for most people. Did we say rarely? Yes. Beware. You
have been warned.


Life insurance is a way of protecting your “human capital,” that is your future income potential. It
is used when you want to protect a future lifestyle of someone who is dependent upon you and about
whom you care. It is a recognition that if you live, you will take care of certain people in certain
ways and an further acknowledgement that you want that care to continue even in the event of your
death. Term life insurance is extremely inexpensive.


For now, [Select Quote](http://www.selectquote.com/landing_t.aspx?cid=t:knc:c:64307662:ad:5684456182:se:gog:k:Term_Life_Insurance_quotes:m:Exact:d:c&gclid=CIL2usKmlb8CFSwS7Aodlw4ApA) is a good site to get an idea of costs and to acquire coverage.


Investments 1-4 above are really all you need to construct a perfect and diversified portfolio.
Simple, no?


If you are in your accumulation/pre-retirement stage, term life insurance is also a very important
tool for those who have people in their lives that they are taking care of financially.


The remaining options are just that, optional. Some investors may want to add other categories of
investments for their own purposes. They are listed below.


#### 6. 

US bond index funds/ETFs. Bonds are often seen as “less risky” than stocks. It should be noted at
this moment that bonds have had a 30-40 year bull market, benefiting directly from falling interest
rates. Rates have little room to fall right now. Whether rates will increase, by how much, and when
is anybody’s guess.


To the extent you employ a laddered portfolio of TIPS as mentioned above, a bond fund may be
unnecessary for your “risk” portfolio. Nevertheless, a short or intermediate bond fund may provide a
risk portfolio (your money invested for the long term that is not invested in TIPS and annuities)
with less overall volatility along the way.


Good options in this regard are:


* [Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&FundIntExt=INT)
* [Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0928&FundIntExt=INT)
* [iShares Core Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)](http://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf)


#### 7. 

International index bond funds/ETFs. International bond exposure adds the element (among other
factors) of currency risk. That risk, of course, can work for or against investors at different
times.


To further diversify the bond component (again, beyond what you are doing with your laddered TIPS
portfolio), an investor may choose to add an international bond fund or ETF.


* [Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund (VTIBX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1231&FundIntExt=INT)
* [Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3711&FundIntExt=INT)


#### 8. 

Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) -- US and Global


Real estate has been seen as an asset class unto itself. One liquid and simple way to participate in
real estate investing is through a Real Estate Investment Trust or [REIT](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp). To get this exposure, you
may want to review the following:

[Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0123&FundIntExt=INT)

Authors’ Note: Now you might think by now that in a former life we worked for Vanguard. None of the
authors has ever worked for Vanguard nor do any of us currently receive any compensation or benefit
from Vanguard. And by listing Vanguard Index options here, we by no means, intend to limit our
recommendations to simply Vanguard. Though that would make things, as we like them, simple, wouldn’t
it?

There are other excellent fund and ETF index alternatives through Fidelity and iShares, among
others.


#### 9. 

Individual stocks and bonds from a low cost brokerage firm. Concentrated and “buy and hold.”

Once you have ensured a guaranteed stream of retirement income through TIPS and annuities, you get
to choose how to pursue the risk portion of your portfolio. You can invest broadly diversified, low
cost index stock and bond fund, or you can invest in concentrated individual stock and bond
positions. The advantage of eschewing diversification and concentrating your holdings is that you
can win big. You can also lose equally big. But one of the most famous investors of all time, Warren
Buffet, loves to concentrate his holdings and believes that it allows you to know what you own more
thoroughly.


Hard to argue with success, on the other hand, we'll know of Warren Buffet because he is not lost in
the noise of a million other highly successful investors. That is, he appears to be somewhat unique.
Nevertheless, concentration is one way to shoot for big gains. If you are not going to shoot for
concentrated big gains, we suggest the low cost, diversified index portfolio route.



#### 10. 

Other investments. What can we say about “other” investments? You can certainly invest in
individual stocks and bonds of all stripes. If you have the time and interest, have at it. You could
buy and manage real estate, collect art, baseball cards, or rare coins. You can even head to Vegas.
One of the authors regularly buys Powerball lottery tickets as part of his asset allocation.
“Investing” is in the eye of the beholder.


In the end, we believe you should use the guarantees (such as they are) of TIPS and income annuities
to build yourself a retirement floor. Plan, don’t guess and hope. Beyond that, once you enter the
world of risk, we recommend owning the entire world stock market in a diversified bucket. You can do
that with just one fund or a couple. But you don’t need more than a few.


If you want to do something beyond that, that’s your call. Good luck. (Which, by the way, is exactly
what they say to you each time you purchase a Powerball ticket.)
